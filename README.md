##  Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a **CI/CD pipeline for a Java application** using **GitHub Actions**.  

The project is designed to automatically:
- Build the Java application with Gradle  
- Run unit tests  
- Generate reports (e.g., JUnit, test coverage)  
- Provide quick feedback on bugs and errors  

###  Why This Matters
Before CI/CD:
- Testing had to be run **manually** after every code change.  
- Bugs and errors were easy to **miss**.  
- It was slow and repetitive to recheck code.  

With GitHub Actions CI/CD:
- Every commit triggers an **automated pipeline**.  
- Tests run automatically and **highlight bugs instantly**.  
- Developers save time and improve code quality.

*COMMANDS/STEPS* : 


---

# 1️- Build & Test
- Java app built with **Gradle**
- Unit tests run automatically  
./gradlew build

---

# 2- GitHub Actions Workflow

- Workflow file: .github/workflows/ci.yml
Runs on every push or pull request:

- Checkout repo

- Set up Java

- Run Gradle build & tests

- Upload reports

# 3️- Docker (Optional)

- App can be containerized:

- docker build -t java-app .
- docker run -p 8080:8080 java-app

---

# Notes

- CI/CD Pipeline Benefits: Automated workflows significantly reduce bugs reaching production, accelerate testing cycles, and ensure more reliable deployments with rollback capabilities

- Gradle Build System: Provides powerful dependency management and build automation - learned to leverage incremental builds for faster compilation and better resource utilization


- GitHub Actions: Discovered the importance of caching dependencies (Gradle cache) to reduce build times from 5+ minutes to under 2 minutes whcih is extremely helpful with beign able to move on to the next tasks even quicker  such as:fixing the bugs,looking at the outcome or simply moving ot the enxt stage of the development proccess.


- Testing Strategy: Unit tests should run first in the pipeline to fail fast and save resources - integration tests can follow. Learned importance of test isolation and avoiding shared state

- Future Improvements:
Containerization: Extend pipeline to include Docker image builds and push to container registry (Docker Hub/AWS ECR) with multi-stage builds for mroe effection work so simply optimization

- Kubernetes Deployment: Add automated deployment stages to K8s clusters for staging and production environments with health checks and rolling updates

# Conclusion

- This project shows how GitHub Actions can transform a manual Java testing workflow into an automated CI/CD pipeline.
It provides quick feedback, reduces human error, and makes development faster and more reliable.
